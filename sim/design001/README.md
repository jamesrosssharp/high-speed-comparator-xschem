=========

Initial design of high speed clocked comparator circuit. Need to simulate:-

- Clock frequency of 50MHz
- Linear sweep of differential voltage -100mV - 100mV
- Make sure output is as expected

For temperature 25 Deg. C, 40 Deg. C and 85 Deg. C

For common mode 0.4V - 1.5V

Check for all process corners.

Use a python script to extract results.
